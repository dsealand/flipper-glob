##### Note for running the code #####
GitHub does not upload the packages when pushing
You must run the following lines before using yarn start to run the webpage

npm install -g create-react-app
yarn add firebase --dev
npm install -g firebase-tools

##### Note for Deploy Firebase Hosting #####
Andreas needs to look into this more but google gave me the lines
firebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy
Seems like a good start
